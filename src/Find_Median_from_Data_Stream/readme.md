This question does not require a sorted array; it just needs the max and min values of `less_queue` and `larger_queue`.

Please review the `addNum()` function in [the heapq method](find_median_from_data_stream_heap_build_in.py) and compare it with [the heap method](find_median_from_data_stream_heap.py). The former does not require comparing `num` with the median.
